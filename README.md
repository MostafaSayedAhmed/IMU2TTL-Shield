# Shield Documentation Project

## Overview

This project provides detailed documentation and design guidelines for building a sensor shield that combines an **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)** with **TTL Serial Communication**. The shield is designed for applications that require accurate orientation and motion detection, such as robotics, drones, and other embedded systems.

## Features

- **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)**: 
  - Uses the **BNO055** sensor, which provides 9-axis sensing capabilities through a 3-axis accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer.
  - Supports 6 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) with measurements across translational and rotational axes.
  - Capable of sensor fusion to enhance data accuracy, incorporating algorithms for orientation and heading adjustments.
  
- **TTL Serial Communication**:
  - Integrates a TTL Serial interface using UART protocol for communication between the IMU and other microcontrollers or computing modules.
  - Compatible with devices like the Nvidia Jetson using a **USB2UART** converter.

## Components

- **BNO055 IMU Sensor**: 
  - Configured in UART mode for efficient data transfer.
  - PS1 pin is connected to 3.3V (logic high) and PS0 is connected to GND (logic low).
- **USB2UART Converter**: 
  - Provides seamless connection between the IMU and external devices, converting UART signals to USB format.

## Setup and Connections

1. **IMU Connections**: 
   - Connect the **SCL** pin of the IMU to the **TX** of the USB2UART and **SDA** to **RX**.
   - Configure the IMU in UART mode with PS1 and PS0 pin settings.
   
2. **Power and Wiring**:
   - A 1 mm width wire is recommended as the current is expected to be below 1A.
   - Additional female pin headers are suggested for secure connections.

## Advantages and Limitations

- **Advantages**:
  - Cost-effective, highly available, and compatible with most microcontrollers.
  - Simple integration with common embedded systems.

- **Limitations**:
  - Prone to noise due to poor noise margin in TTL Serial.
  - Limited speed and frequency with higher power consumption at increased frequencies.
